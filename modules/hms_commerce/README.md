After installing the module, set the API URL on page admin/config/hmscommerce.

To display products on an entity, add an integer field to it and set the field's
form widget and formatter to 'Digtap product'.

To add premium functionality to an entity, add the 'Premium content' field to
it. As soon as the Premium content field has a price category value, the content
is premium. If the value is set to '- None -', the content is not premium.
